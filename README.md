# Section 2 Exploratory analysis:
After organizing the data in custom classes in python, I started my exploratory data analysis by plotting the element wise averages of the neuron matrices for each of the different experimental conditions for each session. I defined the conditions as "left true", "right true", "left false", "right false", and "equal true", where the first part of the name corresponds to whether the left or right constrat was higher, and the second part corresponds to whether the mouse predicted it correctly. There were 5*18 graphs in total to reflect the 5 experimental conditions and the 18 sessions.
